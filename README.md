# Embedded Systems and Embedded Linux Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Embedded Systems and Embedded Linux Projects Repository**. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of projects developed during the journey of mastering embedded systems and embedded Linux.

## Projects Overview

1. **QemuVexpress KernelCraft**
   - Description: The QemuVexpress-KernelCraft Project is a comprehensive endeavor aimed at customizing and deploying a tailored Linux kernel on the ARM Cortex-A9-based Vexpress board using the QEMU emulator. This project encompasses various stages, including toolchain customization, bootloader configuration, kernel compilation, root filesystem setup, system initialization, and booting the kernel on the board.

2. **teraRTOS**
   - Description: This project showcases the meticulous development of a real-time operating system (RTOS) optimized for the ARM Cortex-M3 architecture. Tailored for execution on the STM32F103C6T6 development board, with meticulous simulation using STM32Cube IDE, the project unfolds across five structured parts. Each part of this project contributes significant enhancements and insights, facilitating a systematic evolution of the RTOS. Through structured exploration and experimentation, this project offers invaluable learning opportunities for enthusiasts and professionals aspiring to delve into RTOS development for embedded systems.
3. **Smart Private Vehicle Parking**
   - Description: The Smart Parking project is a simulation of a parking system that incorporates two gates, an entry gate, and an exit gate. The system allows an administrator to input authentic IDs initially. Subsequently, when users utilize the RFID scanner for entry or exit, the system processes the request and permits only authentic IDs. Additionally, the system checks the availability of parking slots before granting entry.

4. **Pressure Controlling System**
   - Description: A system that informs the crew of a cabin with an alarm when the pressure exceeds 20 bars in the cabin. The alarm duration equals 60 seconds.


5. **Student Management System**
   - Description: A students information management system which can perform the following operations:
     - Store the first name of the student
     - Store the last name of the student
     - Store unique roll number for every student 
     - Store GPA for every student
     - Store courses registered by the student
